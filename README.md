# Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to develop an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads data into existing tables for Amazing Prime, a streaming company. The code was refactorted from Module 8 to create one function that takes in the three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data. Then, we perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. In doing so, we help Amazing Prime keep their databases updated on a daily basis.
